## Project Title
**Movie Bookings Analysis**

***

## Level
Beginner to Intermediate

---

## Database
MySQL (movies database)

## Project Description
This project focuses on creating a relational database for a cinema booking system, including:

- Movies table with details such as title, genre, release date, rating, and running time.
- Customers table storing customer details like name, gender, age, and email.
- Bookings table capturing booking details including customer, movie, booking date, ticket quantity, timings, and cost.

Using these tables, the project performs queries to:
- Analyze customer demographics
- Track booking counts and revenues
- Retrieve top-rated movies
- Identify customer booking patterns
- Use aggregate functions, JOINs, GROUP BY, and CASE statements for business insights

---

## Objectives
- Set up the database with tables and insert data.
- Query data to find average age of customers by gender.
- Retrieve top-rated movies and ratings.
- Count bookings per movie and genre.
- Identify customers with the highest bookings.
- Calculate revenue over a date range.
- Classify customers into age groups.
- Perform advanced SQL queries using joins, subqueries, and window functions.

## Project Structure

1. **Database Setup**
   - Create `movies`, `customers`, and `bookings` tables.
   - Populate tables with sample data reflecting popular movies and customers.

2. **SQL Queries**
   - Analytical queries to retrieve business insights such as:
     - Average age of male customers
     - Top 4 movies by rating
     - Total bookings per genre
     - Customers with more than two bookings
     - Total revenue in a specified period
     - Customer classification based on age groups
     - And many more.

-- 19. Total bookings per movie (2 approaches)
SELECT m.title, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings FROM movies m LEFT JOIN bookings b ON m.movie_id = b.movie_id GROUP BY m.movie_id, m.title;

SELECT m.title, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings b WHERE b.movie_id = m.movie_id) AS total_bookings FROM movies m;

-- 20. First booking customer (2 approaches)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name FROM bookings b JOIN customers c ON b.customer_id = c.customer_id WHERE b.booking_date = (SELECT MIN(booking_date) FROM bookings);

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name FROM bookings b JOIN customers c ON b.customer_id = c.customer_id ORDER BY b.booking_date, b.timings LIMIT 1;

    SELECT customer_id FROM bookings GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY SUM(ticket_quantity) DESC LIMIT 1
);

-- Alternate approach
WITH customer_tickets AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(ticket_quantity) AS total_tickets FROM bookings GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.gender, c.email_id, c.age
FROM customers c
